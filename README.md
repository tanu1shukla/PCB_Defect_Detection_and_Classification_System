## Infosys Springboard Internship Project
### Topic: PCB Defect Detection and Classification System

Project Objective:
- Develop an automated defect detection and classification system for Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using image processing and deep learning techniques. 
- Employ reference-based image subtraction, contour extraction, and CNN-based classification to identify and label defects. 
- Develope a fully functional frontend web application to allow users to upload PCB images and receive labeled outputs highlighting defects.
