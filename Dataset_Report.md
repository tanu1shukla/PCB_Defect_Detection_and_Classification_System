# PCB Dataset
## Introduction to PCBs
The PCB dataset is primarily a dataset of images of Printed Circuit Boards.
Printed Circuit board is the most important element in an electronic device. A great number of elements are placed on the PCB, Hence its quality has a direct impact on the device performance.

## Aim of the dataset
The PCB is a complex device, and it has become increasingly difficult to detect and classify its defects.
To avoid the shortcomings of manual detection this dataset is
